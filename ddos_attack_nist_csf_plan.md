# DDoS Attack Analysis and NIST CSF Security Plan

## Scenario Summary
A multimedia company offering web design, graphic design, and social media marketing services experienced a DDoS attack that disrupted its internal network for approximately two hours. 
The attack involved a flood of ICMP packets, overwhelming the network and halting normal traffic. The incident management team blocked incoming ICMP packets, shut down non-critical services, and restored critical services to mitigate the impact. 
Investigation revealed that an unconfigured firewall allowed a malicious actor to execute the DDoS attack. 
Post-incident, the network security team implemented measures including a new firewall rule, IP verification, network monitoring software, and an IDS/IPS system.

## Cybersecurity Incident Report and NIST CSF Plan

### 1. Summary
The organization recently suffered a DDoS attack that immobilized the internal network for approximately two hours. 
The incident involved an ICMP flooding attack, where a massive influx of ICMP packets caused network services to become unresponsive. 
The incident management team acted swiftly by blocking incoming ICMP packets, disabling non-critical network services, and restoring critical services. 
A subsequent investigation by the cybersecurity team identified an unconfigured firewall as the vulnerability exploited by a malicious actor to overwhelm the network with a flood of ICMP packets. 
Several security enhancements were implemented post-incident as a response.

### 2. Identify
The cybersecurity team determined that the root cause was an unconfigured firewall, which enabled a malicious actor to exploit this vulnerability. This led to a DDoS attack involving a flood of ICMP packets, overloading the network for nearly two hours.

### 3. Protect
The network security team implemented the following protective measures:
- A new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets.
- Source IP address verification on the firewall to detect spoofed IPs in ICMP packets.
- Network monitoring software to identify abnormal traffic patterns.
- An IDS/IPS system to filter ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics.

### 4. Detect
Enhanced detection capabilities include:
- Deploying IDS/IPS systems to monitor all Internet traffic and detect suspicious patterns.
- Configuring the firewall to identify spoofed IPs in incoming ICMP packets.

### 5. Respond
To halt the attack, the incident management team blocked ICMP packets and related traffic, while taking non-critical network services offline to contain the impact.

### 6. Recover
The recovery process involved restoring critical network services first, followed by non-critical services. 
Additional measures included implementing source IP verification to prevent spoofed IPs in ICMP packets and developing a plan to improve network security in line with NIST CSF guidelines to address future incidents.

## Reflection
This exercise reinforced my understanding of DDoS attacks and the NIST CSFâ€™s structured approach to cybersecurity. 
Analyzing the ICMP flooding incident and applying the Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover functions highlighted the importance of proactive firewall configuration and real-time monitoring.
