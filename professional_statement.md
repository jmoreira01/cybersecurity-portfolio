Professional Statement

I’m a tech enthusiast with a background in web development, skilled in Python, SQL, Java, Laravel, and HTML, and a foundation in IT from completing the Google IT Support course, which sparked my passion for cybersecurity. I love the idea of being in a position where I have to analyze information, protect systems, and mitigate risks, above all,  learn more about it with motivation, because I see it as a good investment in my professional future as well. 
I’m excited to grow in cybersecurity and contribute with solutions that strengthen digital security for organizations.
