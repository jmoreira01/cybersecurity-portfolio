# Botium Toys: Internal Security Audit

## Activity Overview
This project is part of the Google Cybersecurity course, where I conducted an internal security audit for Botium Toys, a fictional U.S.-based toy company. The audit evaluates the company’s security posture by assessing controls and compliance with standards like PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC. The goal is to identify gaps in security controls and compliance practices and provide recommendations to mitigate risks.

## Scenario Summary
Botium Toys is a small business with a single physical location serving as its office, storefront, and warehouse. With a growing online presence, the IT department faces challenges in maintaining compliance and securing critical assets. The audit scope includes all assets and internal processes, with goals to assess existing assets and complete controls and compliance checklists to improve security posture.

Key findings from the risk assessment:
- Inadequate asset management and lack of proper controls.
- Non-compliance with U.S. and international regulations (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR).
- High risk score (8/10) due to missing controls like encryption, IDS, and disaster recovery plans.

## Controls Assessment Checklist
The following table indicates whether Botium Toys currently has each control in place:

| Control | In Place? |
|---------|-----------|
| Least Privilege | No |
| Disaster recovery plans | No |
| Password policies | Yes (but requirements are minimal) | Google says No.
| Separation of duties | No |
| Firewall | Yes |
| Intrusion detection system (IDS) | No |
| Backups | No |
| Antivirus software | Yes |
| Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention for legacy systems | Yes (but no regular schedule) | Google says No.
| Encryption | No |
| Password management system | No |
| Locks (offices, storefront, warehouse) | Yes |
| Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance | Yes |
| Fire detection/prevention (fire alarm, sprinkler system, etc.) | Yes |

## Compliance Checklist
The following tables indicate whether Botium Toys adheres to compliance best practices:

### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
| Best Practice | Adhered To? |
|---------------|-------------|
| Only authorized users have access to customers’ credit card information | No |
| Credit card information is stored, accepted, processed, and transmitted internally, in a secure environment | No |
| Implement data encryption procedures to better secure credit card transaction touchpoints and data | No |
| Adopt secure password management policies | No |

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
| Best Practice | Adhered To? |
|---------------|-------------|
| E.U. customers’ data is kept private/secured | No |
| There is a plan in place to notify E.U. customers within 72 hours if their data is compromised/there is a breach | Yes |
| Ensure data is properly classified and inventoried | No |
| Enforce privacy policies, procedures, and processes to properly document and maintain data | Yes |

### System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)
| Best Practice | Adhered To? |
|---------------|-------------|
| User access policies are established | No |
| Sensitive data (PII/SPII) is confidential/private | No |
| Data integrity ensures the data is consistent, complete, accurate, and has been validated | Yes |
| Data is available to individuals authorized to access it | Yes (but Principle of Least Privilede not applied) | Google says No.

## Recommendations
To improve Botium Toys’ security posture and reduce risks, I recommend the following:
1. **Implement Least Privilege and Separation of Duties**: Reduce risk and overall impact off malicious insider or compromised accounts (Preventive).
2. **Adopt Encryption**: Provide confidentiality to sensitive information (Deterrent).
3. **Establish Disaster Recovery Plans and Backups**: Develop plans and implement backups to ensure business continuity (Corrective).
4. **Deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Install an IDS to detect and prevent anomalous traffic that matches a signature or rule (Detective).
5. **Enhance Password Policies and Management**: Update password policies to meet current standards and implement a centralized password management system. Reduce likelihood of account compromise through brute fforce or dictionary attack techniques (Preventive).
6. **Improve Account Management Policies**: Managing account lifecycle, reducing attack surface, and limiting overall impact from disgruntled former employees and default account usage (Preventive).

## Reflection
This activity helped me apply the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to identify and assess risks in a simulated scenario. The process highlighted the importance of proactive measures like encryption and access controls to protect sensitive data and ensure regulatory compliance.
